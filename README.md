# AccessibilityRefactor
## Description
For this project, I was tasked with refactoring Horiseon's existing website to improve accessibility, correct errors, and increase code efficiency. These tasks included writing semantic HTML elements, adding `alt` and `aria-label` attributes, improving link functionality, condensing CSS script without affecting display or functionality, and ensuring CSS file is properly commented.
